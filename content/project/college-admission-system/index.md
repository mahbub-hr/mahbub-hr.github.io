For higher secondary education, Bangladeshi mainstream students must be enrolled in colleges after passing the Secondary School Certificate Examination (SSC). The goal of this project is to create a web-based application to facilitate the admission process by obeying the guideline passed by the Ministry of Education.
I designed and developed most of the backend APIs. I was also responsible to secure the APIs using Spring Security. One of my most notable contributions to this project is to implement a way to modify API roles at runtime without the need of recompiling the code.
